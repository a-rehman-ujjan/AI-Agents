AI agents are autonomous programs or systems designed to perform tasks, make decisions, or solve problems based on data inputs and programmed objectives. These agents operate independently, often interacting with their environment or other systems to accomplish their goals. They can range from simple task automation to complex decision-making systems.

Here’s how AI agents work and their key features:

### 1. **Autonomy**
   AI agents operate independently without continuous human intervention. Once programmed or given a goal, they act on their own to achieve it.

### 2. **Reactivity**
   They respond to changes in their environment. If the situation or data changes, AI agents can adjust their behavior accordingly, making them dynamic.

### 3. **Proactiveness**
   AI agents can initiate actions based on their goals, not just respond to external inputs. For example, an AI agent could proactively gather information, suggest actions, or execute tasks.

### 4. **Goal-Oriented**
   These agents are designed to achieve specific objectives. Whether it’s optimizing a process, automating tasks, or making decisions, the AI agent is focused on accomplishing its goal efficiently.

### 5. **Learning and Adaptation**
   Many AI agents have the ability to learn from experience. Using techniques like machine learning, they can improve their performance over time based on the feedback they receive from their actions and environment.

### Common Uses of AI Agents:
- **Customer Service**: Chatbots and virtual assistants that handle inquiries and provide solutions.
- **Automation**: Automating routine tasks, like data entry, scheduling, or processing.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products, movies, or content based on user behavior.
- **Decision Support Systems**: Assisting with complex decision-making in fields like finance, healthcare, or logistics.

AI agents can be standalone or part of a multi-agent system, where several agents work together, often in a collaborative or competitive manner.
